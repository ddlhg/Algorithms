# Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to tracking my data structures and algorithms practice.

- [Binary Tree Code](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/BinaryTree) - Insertion, search, and deletion.
- [Quicksort](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/Quicksort) - First element as pivot.
- [Single Linked List](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/SingleLinkedList) - Create "n" nodes, delete from the middle, and insert in the middle.
- [Double Linked List](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/Double%20Linked%20List) - Create "n" nodes, delete from the end, and insert at the beginning.
- [Selection Sort](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/Selection%20Sort)
- [Euclidian Algorithm ](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/EEA) - GCD of two integers.
- [Two Largest](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/Two%20Largest) - Finding 2 largest numbers in a list.
- [Modular Exponentiation](https://github.com/ddlhg/Practice-Algorithms/blob/main/ME) - Calculates a^k mod n.
